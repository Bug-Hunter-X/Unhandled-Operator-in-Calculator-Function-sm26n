# Unhandled Operator in Calculator Function

This JavaScript code implements a simple calculator with functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  However, it contains a bug related to handling operators. The `operate` function only handles a limited set of operators. If the user inputs a valid operator not included in the switch case (e.g., the modulus operator '%'), it throws an error, making the functionality incomplete.

## Bug

The primary issue lies within the `operate` function's `switch` statement. It only covers '+', '-', '*', and '/'.  Any other operator passed to the function will result in the default case of the `switch` statement which throws an error. This error should ideally be handled more gracefully, providing better feedback to the user.

## Solution

The solution involves enhancing the `operate` function to handle additional operators or implementing more robust error handling. For example, we can add a default case to return NaN or provide a more descriptive message. Or we can use an if-else-if block instead for better flexibility. This will make the calculator more robust and user-friendly.
